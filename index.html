          <ol class="breeds">
            <li>
              Siamese
              <p>
                Fun fact: this is my favorite cat breed. I saw them in Lady and
                the Tramp and fell in love with the breed (which was definitely
                not the intended purpose of the writers). They originated in
                Thailand, which is where they got their name: the Siam-ese. They
                have distinct markings called "points" where they are colored.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Persian
              <p>
                Their distinctive smushed face makes them either an instant hit
                or miss, but they also possess luxuriously long fur coats that
                can come in almost any color.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Maine Coon
              <p>
                As is quite obvious from the images above, I adore Maine Coons.
                They are the largest domestic cat breed, holding the record of
                the largest cat ever recorded at 4ft long.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Ragdoll
              <p>
                These cats got their name from their propensity to go limp when
                picked up, much like a rag doll. They are about the size of a
                medium sized dog with the temperament to match.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Bengal
              <p>
                These felines got their name from their distinctive markings
                that make them look like their much larger and much more deadly
                wild cousins: leopards and tigers.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Abyssinian
              <p>
                These cats have a distinctive red/orange coat that is actually
                threaded through with lighter and darker bands.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Birman
              <p>
                They look quite similar to the Siamese and Ragdoll but have no
                undercoat.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Oriental Shorthair
              <p>
                These are some weird looking boys. They usually have piercing
                green eyes but may also come in other colors.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Sphynx
              <p>
                The Sphyx cat is physically incapable of shedding (because they
                have no fur to shed), which gives them a very unique look.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Devon Rex
              <p>
                Initially, I thought that these cats looked incredibly strange
                because of their wavy coat.
